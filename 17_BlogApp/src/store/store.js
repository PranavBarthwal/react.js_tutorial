//Explanation

// This JavaScript code is using Redux Toolkit to set up a Redux store. Redux is a state management library often used with React, but it can be used with any JavaScript application. Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.

// The first line imports the configureStore function from Redux Toolkit. This function simplifies the setup of the Redux store and automatically includes some middleware that are useful for development.

// The second line imports authReducer from a local file named authSlice.js. In Redux, a reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We can assume that authReducer is a reducer function dealing with authentication-related actions and state.

// The configureStore function is then called with an object as its argument. This object has a reducer property, which is an object that maps different parts of the state to their corresponding reducers. In this case, there's only one part of the state, authReducer, which is managed by the authReducer function.

// The result of configureStore is stored in the store constant. This store is the Redux store instance that you can use to dispatch actions or select values from the state.

// Finally, store is exported as the default export of this module, so it can be imported in other parts of the application.
