// This JavaScript code is part of a Redux toolkit setup. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, and Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.

// The `configureStore` function is imported from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. This function simplifies the setup process for a Redux store. It automatically combines the reducer functions you provide, sets up middleware with good default behavior, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

// The `todoReducer` is imported from the `../features/todo/todoSlice` file. This is a slice reducer that handles updates to a specific section of the Redux state tree, in this case, the 'todo' section.

// The `store` is created by calling `configureStore` and passing in an object with the `reducer` property set to `todoReducer`. This means that the `todoReducer` will be used to handle all dispatched actions and calculate the new state.

// The `store` is then exported so it can be used in other parts of the application, such as in the `Provider` component from `react-redux` to make the Redux store available to the rest of the app.
