// This code is a functional component in React named Layout. It's written in JavaScript and uses JSX syntax, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript code.

// The import statements at the top of the file are used to include various modules into the file. The React module is being imported from the 'react' package, but as of React 17, this import is no longer necessary unless you're using React features like React.Component, React.PureComponent, React.memo, or React.lazy.

// The Outlet component is imported from 'react-router-dom', which is a library for routing in React applications. The Outlet component is a placeholder component that renders the child routes when the parent route is matched.

// Footer and Header are custom components imported from local files. These components are likely to contain the layout for the header and footer of the page.

// The Layout function is a functional component that returns a JSX element. This JSX element is a div that contains the Header, Outlet, and Footer components. The Header and Footer components will always be rendered, while the Outlet component will render different components based on the current route.

// Finally, the Layout component is exported as a default export, which means it can be imported in other files using any name. This is typically used in the file where the component is being used to render a layout.
