## CRETATE REACT APP USING VITE
- cd [directory name]
- npm create vite@latest
- add project name
- select a framework
- select a variant
- npm install / npm i (To install required packages or To add node modules folder in our project)
- npm run dev (to open the project)

<br>

## DEPENDENCIES IN REACT
- When your project needs code from other projects in order to do its thing, those other projects are “dependencies”; your project depends on them to run. When you install third-party packages via npm install , you're adding a dependency. Your project's package. json file includes a list of your project's dependencies.

## Here's what each file and directory does:

Sure, let's go through the function of each file in your Vite React app:

1. **`node_modules/`:**
   - This directory contains all the dependencies for your project. When you run `npm install` or `yarn install`, the packages are downloaded and stored here.

2. **`public/`:**
   - This directory contains static assets that will be served as-is by the development server and copied to the build output during the production build.
   - `index.html` is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your application.

   ```html
   <!-- public/index.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
       <title>My Vite React App</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <div id="app"></div>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **`src/`:**
   - This directory contains your application's source code.
   - `components/` is a common directory to organize React components.
   - `main.jsx` is the entry point for your React application. It renders the root component (`App`) into the HTML element with the id 'app'.

   ```jsx
   // src/components/App.jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import Header from './Header';
   import Footer from './Footer';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Header />
         <p>Main Content of the App</p>
         <Footer />
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

   ```jsx
   // src/components/Header.jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function Header() {
     return <header>Header Component</header>;
   }

   export default Header;
   ```

   ```jsx
   // src/components/Footer.jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function Footer() {
     return <footer>Footer Component</footer>;
   }

   export default Footer;
   ```

   ```jsx
   // src/main.jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import App from './components/App';

   ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
   ```

4. **`.gitignore`:**
   - This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git, the version control system. It prevents sensitive information and unnecessary files from being included in your repository.

5. **`package.json`:**
   - This file contains metadata about your project and its dependencies.
   - It also includes scripts for running various tasks, such as starting the development server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), building the project, and running tests.

6. **`yarn.lock` (or `package-lock.json`):**
   - This file, generated by Yarn or npm, records the exact versions of dependencies installed in your project. It ensures that other developers get the same dependencies when they run `yarn install` or `npm install`.

7. **`vite.config.js`:**
   - Vite uses this configuration file to customize its behavior.
   - You can set up various options here, such as plugins, custom aliases, or optimization settings. For a basic setup, an empty config file is often sufficient.

   ```javascript
   // vite.config.js
   export default {};
   ```

These files collectively provide the structure and configuration for your Vite React application, allowing you to organize your code, manage dependencies, and control the build process.

## GOOD PRACTICE
- Functions, components & files name should start with capital letter in both React Project aur React Project using Vite.
- In basic React App if any HTML is returned from a file then it is named <code>.jsx</code> and if HTML return nhi ho rha hai to it is named <code>.js</code>
- Vite wale project mein it forces us to name every file with <code>.jsx</code>

## React Virtual DOM

The React Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a key concept in React's rendering process that enhances performance and efficiency when updating the user interface. Here's an overview of how it works:

1. **Real DOM**:
   - The browser maintains a tree-like structure known as the DOM, which represents the structure of HTML elements in the document.
   - Whenever there's a change in the state or props of a React component, React traditionally updates the Real DOM directly.

2. **Reconciliation**:
   - When a component's state or props change, React calculates the difference between the new virtual representation of the UI and the current state of the Real DOM. This process is known as reconciliation.
   - Reconciliation can be an expensive operation, especially for complex UIs or frequent updates.

3. **Virtual DOM**:
   - Instead of directly manipulating the Real DOM, React uses a lightweight copy of the DOM, known as the Virtual DOM, to perform the calculations during the reconciliation process.
   - The Virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation of the Real DOM. It is a tree structure that mirrors the actual structure of the UI.

4. **Diffing Algorithm**:
   - React uses a process called "reconciliation" or "diffing" to determine the minimum number of steps needed to update the Real DOM to match the new state or props of a component.
   - The diffing algorithm compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one, identifying the differences (or "diffs") between them.

5. **Batched Updates**:
   - React batches multiple state updates and executes them in a single pass to the Virtual DOM. This helps reduce the number of times the Real DOM is updated, improving performance.

6. **Efficient Updates to Real DOM**:
   - Once the differences are identified through the Virtual DOM, React updates only the specific parts of the Real DOM that need to change, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.
   - This selective update minimizes the performance cost associated with DOM manipulation.

By using the Virtual DOM and a smart reconciliation process, React optimizes the updating process, resulting in a more efficient and responsive user interface. The Virtual DOM helps abstract away direct manipulation of the Real DOM and provides a more developer-friendly and performant approach to building dynamic web applications.
