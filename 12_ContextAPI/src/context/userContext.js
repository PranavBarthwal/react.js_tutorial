import React from "react";

const UserContext = React.createContext();

export default UserContext;



// This code is creating a context in React using the createContext function, which is a part of the React API. The context is being stored in a constant named UserContext.

// Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

// The createContext function is called without any arguments, which means the context will be initialized with an undefined value. You could provide a default value by passing it as an argument to createContext.

// Finally, UserContext is exported as a default export, which means it can be imported in other files using any name. This UserContext will typically be used with the Provider and Consumer components (or the useContext hook) that the createContext function returns to share state across the component tree.
